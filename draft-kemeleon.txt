                         draft-kemeleon-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies Kemeleon encoding, algorithms for encoding
   ML-KEM public keys and ciphertexts as random bytestrings.  Kemeleon
   encodings provide obfuscation of public keys and ciphertexts, relying
   on module LWE assumptions.  This document specifies a number of
   variants of these encodings, with differing rejection rates, output
   sizes, and performance profiles.

1.  Introduction

   ML-KEM [FIPS203] is a post-quantum key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM)
   recently standardized by NIST, Many applications are transitioning
   from classical Diffie-Hellman (DH) based solutions to constructions
   based on ML-KEM.  The use of Elligator and related Hash-to-Curve
   [RFC9380] algorithms are ubiquitous in DH-based protocols where DH
   shares are required to be encoded as, and look indistinguishable
   from, random bytestrings.  For example, applications using Elligator
   include protocols used for censorship circumvention in Tor [OBFS4],
   password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocols [CPACE]
   [OPAQUE], and private set intersection (PSI) [ECDH-PSI].

   For the post-quantum transition, an analogous encoding for (ML-)KEM
   public keys and ciphertexts to random bytestrings is required.  This
   document specifies such an encoding, Kemeleon, for ML-KEM public keys
   and ciphertexts.  Kemeleon was introduced in [GSV24] for building an
   (post-quantum) "obfuscated" KEM whose public keys and ciphertexts are
   indistinguishable from random.  Beyond the original construction,
   this document additionally specifies variants that avoid the encoding
   failing or the use of large integer computations, or allow for a
   deterministic encoding.  Aside from these variants, it is notable
   that the Kemeleon encodings of public keys results in smaller
   representations than in the original ML-KEM specification.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Notation / ML-KEM Background

   A KEM consists of three algorithms:

   *  'KeyGen() -> (ek, dk)': A probabilistic key generation algorithm
      that, with no input, generates a public (encapsulation) key 'ek'
      and a secret (decapsulation) key 'dk'.

   *  'Encaps(ek) -> (c, K)': A probabilistic encapsulation algorithm
      that takes as input a public key 'ek', and outputs a ciphertext
      'ct' and shared secret key 'K'.

   *  'Decaps(dk, c) -> K': A decapsulation algorithm that takes as
      input a secret key 'dk' and ciphertext 'c', and outputs a shared
      secret key 'K'.

   TODO: * ML-KEM specifics (q, compress, decompress, ...)

   ML-KEM.KeyGen() (Section 7.1 [FIPS203]) produces a public key, ek,
   (termed an encapsulation key in [FIPS203]) and a private key, dk,
   (decapsulation key).  Public keys consist of byte-encoded vectors of
   coefficients in Z_q, where each coefficient is encoded in 12 bits,
   together with a 32-byte seed for generating the matrix A.  ML-
   KEM.Encaps(ek) (Section 7.2 [FIPS203]) produces ciphertexts
   consisting of byte-encoded compressed vectors of cofficients, where
   each coefficient in Z_q is compressed by a certain number of bits
   (depending on the ML-KEM parameter set).

   The following terms and notation are used throughout this document:

   *  msb(x) refers to the most significant bit of the value x

   *  a[i] denotes the ith position of a vector a of coefficients

   *  concat(x0, ..., xN): returns the concatenation of bytestrings.

4.  Kemeleon encoding

   At a high level, the constructions in this document instantiate the
   following functions:

   *  EncodePk(ek) -> eek is the (possibly randomized) encoding
      algorithm that on input a public key, outputs an obfuscated public
      key or an error.

   *  DecodePk(eek) -> ek is the deterministic decoding algorithm that
      on input an obfuscated public key, outputs a public key.

   *  EncodeCtxt(c) -> ec is the (possibly randomized) encoding
      algorithm that on input a ciphertext, outputs an obfuscated
      ciphertext or an error.

   *  DecodeCtxt(ec) -> c is the deterministic decoding algorithm that
      on input an obfuscated ciphertext, outputs a ciphertext.

4.1.  Common functions

   VectorEncode(a):
      r = 0
      for i from 1 to k*n:
         r += q^(i-1)*a[i]
      if msb(r) == 1:
         return err
      else:
         return r

   VectorDecode(r):
      for i from 1 to k*n:
         t = 0
         for j from 1 to i-1:
            t += a[j]
         a[i] = (r - t)/(q^(i-1)) % q
      return a

   The following algorithm recovers randomness from a compressed
   ciphertext coefficient.  The mapping is based on the Compress_d,
   Decompress_d algorithms from (Section 4.2.1 [FIPS203]).

   RecoverFrom_d(u,c):
      if d == 10:
         if Compress_d(u - 2) == c:
            rand <--$ [-2,-1,0,1]
         else:
            rand <--$ [-1,0,1]
         return u + rand
      if d == 11:

      else:
         return err

4.2.  Encoding public keys

   Kemeleon1.EncodePk(ek = (t, rho)):
      r = VectorEncode(t)
      if r == err:
         return err
      else:
         return concat(r,rho)

   Kemeleon1.DecodePk(eek):
      r,rho = eek // rho is fixed lenght
      t = VectorDecode(r)
      return (t, rho)

4.3.  Encoding ciphertexts

   TODO: complete

   Kemeleon1.EncodeCtxt(c = (c_1,c_2)):
      u = Decompress_d(c_1,d_u)
      for i from 1 to k*n:
         x = RecoverFrom_d(u[i],c[i])

4.4.  Deterministic variant

4.5.  Faster arithmetic variant

4.6.  Non-rejection sampling variant

5.  Obfuscated KEMs

   This section describes how to use the above specified encoding
   algorithms in conjunction with a KEM to produce an obfuscated KEM
   [GSV24].

6.  Security Considerations

   This section contains additional security considerations about the
   Kemeleon encodings described in this document.

6.1.  Randomness sampling

   Both public key and ciphertext encodings in the original Kemeleon
   encoding are randomized.  The randomness (or seed used to generate
   randomness) MUST NOT be derived from a public source.  For public key
   encodings, randomness can be stored with the respective secret key.
   In particular, using a public source of randomness would reveal ...

6.2.  Timing side-channels

   (also from resampling)

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
