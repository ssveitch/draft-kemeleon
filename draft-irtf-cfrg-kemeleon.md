--- abstract

This document specifies Kemeleon encoding algorithms for encoding ML-KEM encapsulation keys and ciphertexts as random bytestrings.
Kemeleon encodings provide obfuscation of encapsulation keys and ciphertexts, relying on module LWE assumptions.
This document specifies a number of variants of these encodings, with differing failure rates, output sizes, and performance profiles.

# Introduction {#intro}

ML-KEM {{FIPS203}} is a post-quantum key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) recently standardized by NIST,
Many applications are transitioning from classical Diffie-Hellman (DH) based solutions to constructions based on ML-KEM.
The use of Elligator and related Hash-to-Curve {{RFC9380}} algorithms are ubiquitous in DH-based protocols where DH shares are required to be encoded as, and look indistinguishable from, random bytestrings.
For example, applications using Elligator include protocols used for censorship circumvention in Tor {{OBFS4}}, password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocols {{?CPACE=I-D.irtf-cfrg-cpace}} {{?OPAQUE=I-D.irtf-cfrg-opaque}}, and private set intersection (PSI) {{?ECDH-PSI=I-D.ecdh-psi}}.

For the post-quantum transition, an analogous encoding for (ML-)KEM encapsulation keys and ciphertexts to random bytestrings is required.
This document specifies such an encoding, Kemeleon, for ML-KEM encapsulation keys and ciphertexts.
Kemeleon was introduced in {{GSV24}} for building an (post-quantum) "obfuscated" KEM whose encapsulation keys and ciphertexts are indistinguishable from random.
Different than the original construction, this document specifies an encoding that avoids any failure probability in the encoding and allows for a deterministic encoding.

# Conventions and Definitions {#conventions}

# Notation / ML-KEM Background {#notation}

A KEM consists of three algorithms:

- `KeyGen() -> (ek, dk)`: A probabilistic key generation algorithm that, with no input, generates an encapsulation key `ek` and a decapsulation key `dk`.
- `Encaps(ek) -> (c, K)`: A probabilistic encapsulation algorithm that takes as input an encapsulation key `ek`, and outputs a ciphertext `ct` and shared secret `K`.
- `Decaps(dk, c) -> K`: A decapsulation algorithm that takes as input a decapsulation key `dk` and ciphertext `c`, and outputs a shared secret `K`.

The following variables and functions are adopted from {{FIPS203}}:

- `q = 3329`, `n = 256`
- `Compress_d : x -> round((2^d/q)*x) mod 2^d` (Equation 4.7)
- `Decompress_d : y -> round((q/2^d)*y)` (Equation 4.8)
- remaining parameters `k`, `d_u`, `d_v`, etc. are defined by the respective ML-KEM parameter set -- this document writes `du` and `dv` in place of `d_u`, `d_v` in pseudocode

`ML-KEM.KeyGen()` (Section 7.1 {{FIPS203}}) produces an encapsulation key, `ek` and a decapsulation key, `dk`.
Encapsulation keys consist of byte-encoded vectors of coefficients in Z_q, where each coefficient is encoded in 12 bits, together with a 32-byte seed for generating the matrix `A`.
`ML-KEM.Encaps(ek)` (Section 7.2 {{FIPS203}}) produces ciphertexts consisting of byte-encoded compressed vectors of cofficients, where each coefficient in Z_q is compressed by a certain number of bits (depending on the ML-KEM parameter set).

The following terms and notation are used throughout this document:

- `a[i]` denotes the `i`th position of a vector `a` of coefficients
- `concat(x0, ..., xN)`: returns the concatenation of bytestrings.

# Kemeleon Encoding {#kemeleon}

At a high level, the constructions in this document instantiate the following functions:

- `EncodePk(ek) -> eek` is the (possibly randomized) encoding algorithm that on input an encapsulation key, outputs an obfuscated encapsulation key or an error.
- `DecodePk(eek) -> ek` is the deterministic decoding algorithm that on input an obfuscated encapsulation key, outputs an encapsulation key.
- `EncodeCtxt(c) -> ec` is the (possibly randomized) encoding algorithm that on input a ciphertext, outputs an obfuscated ciphertext or an error.
- `DecodeCtxt(ec) -> c` is the deterministic decoding algorithm that on input an obfuscated ciphertext, outputs a ciphertext.

## Common Functions {#common-func}

The following function maps a vector k*n of coefficients modulo q to a large integer.
Applying the technique from {{ELL2}}, where `r` is the large integer resulting from accumulating coefficients, we then choose `m` at random from `[0,floor((2^(b+t)-r)/(q^(k*n)))]`, where `b = ceil(k*n*log2(q))` and `t` is a security parameter, and return `r + m*q^(k*n)`.
Notably, the random value `m` need not be transmitted alongside the encoded values.
This results in encoded values whose statistical distance from uniform is at most `2^-t`.
Notably, this statistical distance is unconditional; we hence fix `t=128`.
This results in the encoding size increasing by `t` bits, i.e., 16 bytes.

~~~
VectorEncode(a,k):
   r = 0
   t = 128
   b = ceil(k*n*log2(q))
   for i from 1 to k*n:
      r += q^(i-1)*a[i]
   m <--$ [0,...,floor((2^(b+t)-r)/(q^(k*n)))]
   return r + m*q^(k*n)
~~~

~~~
VectorDecode(r,k):
   r = r % q^(k*n)
   for i from 1 to k*n:
      a[i] = r % q
      r = r // q
   return a
~~~

The following algorithm samples an uncompressed pre-image of a coefficient `c` at random, where `u` is the decompressed value of `c`.
It must take as input values of `u` that are output from `Decompress_d`.
The mapping is based on the `Compress_d`, `Decompress_d` algorithms from (Section 4.2.1 {{FIPS203}}).

~~~
SamplePreimage(d,u,c):
   if d == 10:
      if Compress_d(u + 2) == c:
         rand <--$ [-1,0,1,2]
      else if Compress_d(u - 2) == c:
         rand <--$ [-2,-1,0,1]
      else:
         rand <--$ [-1,0,1]
      return u + rand
   if d == 11:
      if Compress_d(u + 1) == c:
         rand <--$ [0,1]
      else if Compress_d(u - 1) == c:
         rand <--$ [-1,0]
      else:
         rand = 0
      return u + rand
   if d == 5:
      if u == 0:
         rand <--$ [-52,...,52]
      else if u <= 1560:
         rand <--$ [-51,...,52]
      else:
         rand <--$ [-52,...,51]
      return u + rand
   if d == 4:
      if u == 0:
         rand <--$ [-104,...,104]
      else if u <= 1456:
         rand <--$ [-103,...,104]
      else:
         rand <--$ [-104,...,103]
      return u + rand
   else:
      return err
~~~

## Encoding Encapsulation Keys {#pk-encoding}

The following algorithms encode ML-KEM encapsulation keys as random bytestrings.
`rho` is the public seed used to generate the public matrix `A` {{FIPS203}}.
This is already a random 32-byte string, so it is returned alongside the encoded value of `t`.
`t` is a vector of `k` polynomials with `n` coefficients, but in the following pseudocode `t` is treated as a vector of `k*n` coefficients.

~~~
Kemeleon.EncodePk(ek = (t, rho)):
   r = VectorEncode(t,k)
   if r == err:
      return err
   else:
      return concat(r,rho)
~~~

~~~
Kemeleon.DecodePk(eek):
   r,rho = eek # rho is fixed length
   t = VectorDecode(r,k)
   return (t, rho)
~~~

## Encoding Ciphertexts {#ctxt-encoding}

ML-KEM ciphertexts consist of two components: `c_1`, a vector of `k` polynomials with `n` coefficients mod `2^du`, and `c_2`, a polynomial with `n` coefficients mod `2^dv`.
The coefficients of these polynomials are not uniformly distributed, as a result of the compression step in encapsulation.
The following encoding function decompresses and recovers a random preimage of this compression step in order to recover the uniform distribution of coefficients.
Then, the same vector encoding step used for encapsulation keys is applied.

~~~
Kemeleon.EncodeCtxt(c = (c_1,c_2)):
   u = Decompress_du(c_1)
   for i from 1 to k*n:
      u[i] = SamplePreimage(du,u[i],c_1[i])
   v = Decompress_dv(c_2)
   for i from 1 to n:
      v[i] = SamplePreimage(dv,v[i],c_2[i])
   w = [u,v] # treat u,v as a singular vector of (k+1)*n coefficients
   r = VectorEncode(w,k+1)
   return r
~~~

~~~
Kemeleon.DecodeCtxt(r):
   w = VectorDecode(r,k+1)
   u,v = w # u, v are fixed length
   c_1 = Compress_du(u)
   c_2 = Compress_dv(v)
   return (c_1,c_2)
~~~

# Additional Considerations for Applications {#considerations}

This section contains additional considerations and comments related to using Kemeleon encodings in different applications.

## Deterministic Encoding {#deterministic}

The randomness used in `Kemeleon` ciphertext encodings MAY be derived in a deterministic manner.
To do so, following a call to `Encap` which returns a KEM key `K` and a ciphertext `c`, the following steps can be taken:

- Using a key derivation function (KDF), derive from the key `K` a new key `K'` and a seed for randomness `rnd`.
- The seed `rnd` can be used to generate the randomness required when encoding the ciphertext `c`.
- Use `K'` in place of `K` wherever applicable in the remainder of the protocol/system.
- Upon any call to `Decap`, apply the same KDF to derive the new key `K'`, as required.

Deriving a new KEM key for use in the remainder of a system is crucial in order to ensure key separation (i.e., the implementation MUST NOT use the original key `K` to derive randomness and for other purposes).

The randomness used to encode an encapsulation key MAY be stored alongside the corresponding decapsulation key, if it is subsequently needed.
See {{randomness-security}} for relevant discussion on keeping this randomness secret.

## Relation to Hash-to-Curve {#hash-to-curve}

While the functionality of Kemeleon is similar to hash-to-curve {{RFC9380}} (mapping arbitrary byte strings to public keys/ciphertexts), the applications where hash-to-curve is used do not immediately follow in the KEM-based setting because having such an encapsulation key (without dk) or ciphertext (without dk or ek) does not appear to provide the same functionality, since it is not clear how to continue working with the element in the same way that can be done with an elliptic curve point.

## Modifying ML-KEM Algorithms {#direct-generation}

In applications that _only_ require Kemeleon-encoded values _and_ where the underlying ML-KEM implementation can be modified, the ciphertext encoding algorithm (and ML-KEM encapsulation/decapsulation algorithms) MAY be adapted as follows for improved efficiency.
In particular, the compression step in the ML-KEM encapsulation algorithm can be omitted, and therefore, the decompression step in the Kemeleon algorithm can be omitted.
In the implementation of ML-KEM, the compression step (lines 22-23 of Algorithm 14 {{FIPS203}}) and corresponding decompression step (lines 3-4 of Algorithm 15 {{FIPS203}}) can be omitted from the encapsulation/decapsulation algorithms in ML-KEM.
In this case, the Kemeleon encoding algorithm for ciphertexts would omit the `Decompress` and `SamplePreimage` steps and immediately apply `VectorEncode`:

~~~
Kemeleon.EncodeCtxt(c = (c_1,c_2)):
   w = [c_1,c_2] # treat c_1,c_2 as a singular vector of (k+1)*n coefficients
   r = VectorEncode(w,k+1)
   return r
~~~

Decoding is adapted analogously.

~~~
Kemeleon.DecodeCtxt(ec):
   w = VectorDecode(r,k+1)
   c_1,c_2 = w # c_1, c_2 are fixed length
   return (c_1,c_2)
~~~

# Security Considerations {#security}

This section contains additional security considerations about the Kemeleon encodings described in this document.

## Computational Assumptions {#assumptions}
In general, the obfuscation properties of the Kemeleon encodings depend on module LWE assumptions similar to those underlying the IND-CCA security of ML-KEM; see {{GSV24}} for the detailed security analysis of the original Kemeleon encoding.
In particular, the notions of public key and ciphertext uniformity capture the indistinguishability of Kemeleon-encoded encapsulation keys and ciphertexts from random bitstrings, respectively.
Both require the module LWE assumption to hold in order for Kemeleon to maintain its uniformity properties.
Furthermore, distinguishing a pair of a Kemeleon-encoded encapsulation key and a Kemeleon-encoded ciphertext from uniformly random bitstrings also reduces to a module LWE assumption.

## Randomness Sampling {#randomness-security}
Both encapsulation key and ciphertext encodings in the original Kemeleon encoding are randomized.
The randomness (or seed used to generate randomness) used in Kemeleon encodings MUST be kept secret.
In particular, public randomness enables distinguishing a Kemeleon-encoded value from a random bytestring:
Decoding the value in question and re-encoding it with the public randomness will yield the original value if it was Kemeleon-encoded.

## Timing Side-Channels {#timing-security}
Beyond timing side-channel considerations for ML-KEM itself, care should be taken when using Kemeleon encodings, in particular those with a non-zero failure probability.
Rejecting and re-generating encapsulation keys or ciphertexts may leak information about the use of Kemeleon encodings, as might the overhead of the encoding itself.
Additionally, the algorithms required to perform big integer arithmetic may leak information via timing.
