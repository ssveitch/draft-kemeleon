      "body": "John Mattson (Feb 26 CFRG email) suggested:\n\n> The Kemeleon approach is useful if you have ML-KEM in hardware and wants to obfuscate in software. For an implementation like Tor that always obfuscated public keys and ciphertexts, I don\u2019t think compressing and then decompressing and rejection sampling makes any sense. It is a waste of CPU cycles and energy. I think the document should describe how the algorithms in FIPS 203 can be modified to include the Kemeleon encoding directly without reencoding. I think this would be a more useful approach for most implementations requiring obfuscated keys.\n",
