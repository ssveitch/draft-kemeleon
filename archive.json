For an implementation like Tor that always obfuscated public keys and ciphertexts, I don\u2019t think compressing and then decompressing and rejection sampling makes any sense. It is a waste of CPU cycles and energy. I think the document should describe how the algorithms in FIPS 203 can be modified to include the Kemeleon encoding directly without reencoding. I think this would be a more useful approach for most implementations requiring obfuscated keys.\n",

      "body": "Dan Harkins (27 Feb CFRG mailing list) suggested:\n\n> Some comments on the No Rejection Variant in section 4.4:\n> 1. There's a security parameter, t, used in encoding of the public key. The text mentions \"For example, t=128....\" implying it could be something else. But both sides have to agree on it and it seems like an unnecessary knob. Better to fix it based on the security level of the particular flavor of ML-KEM being used.So security level 1 has t=128, 3 has t=192, and 5 has t=256.\n> 2. when encoding the ciphertext, the vector being encoded is has (k+1)*n coefficients and the text says to use (k+1) when accumulating to a large integer. That means when I'm summing r I loop from 1 to (k+1)*n but does that also mean that all other occurrences of q^(k*n) should be q^((k+1)*n)? Like computing b and the range from which to choose m and the value multiplied by m? Is that all q^((k+1)*n)? And the (k+1) note also needs to be applied to the ciphertext decode function, Kemeleon.DecodeCtxtNR().\n> 3. The text has Kemeleon.DecodeCtxtNR() being called with \"ec\" but it should be \"r\".\n\nPoint 3. has been resolved.",

Notably, the security parameter `t` gives _unconditional_ statistical distance of 2^-t. It's hence sufficient to fix this to `t = 128` for all practical purposes. In particular, this is different from ML-KEMs security level (128/192/256), which corresponds to _computational_ MLWE hardness.\n\nPut in #8 to fix `t = 128` and explain.",
